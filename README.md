# KnitWatch3
App to keep track of your knitting needles, yarn, and projects

Here's the program as it is at the moment. Most of it works, but it's not finished, deleting a project is missing and
I still want to add tons of functionality, checking for proper input, etc.

(as to the input: at the moment you really need to be careful when adding new items. There has to be the exact same amount
of ';'s, and you can't leave anything blank. Numbers can be "5" or "5.0" or "5.5" etc., except in for example the project
tab, as I didn't feel that project priority or difficulty needed to be measured in anything smaller than whole numbers.
So there only "5" works, on a scale from 0 to 10 I believe. It's a work in progress.)

I still run this program straight from NetBeans, so I can't instruct you on how to run it (unless you use NetBeans, but in
that case I assume you can run it for yourself.) Learning how to make an .exe file out of this is on my to do -list.

This is my second rewrite of the program, hence the name. This is my first, and so far only, big project.
All work is done by me, Sofia Vanhanen.
